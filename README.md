# Day 5 of 30:
### Today, I focused on understanding Stateful widgets, utilizing AnimatedContainer, and implementing Future.delayed in Flutter. Learning about Stateful widgets helped me manage state within my application more effectively. I also experimented with AnimatedContainer to add smooth animations to my UI, enhancing the user experience. Additionally, using Future.delayed allowed me to introduce delays in my code, which can be useful for tasks like splash screens or timed actions.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! ðŸš€ðŸ“±
